Class 9 ICSE Computer Applications Project
Author: Ali Mubeen Siddiqui

This folder contains my Java programs for school, written in BlueJ. Each file is a small program (like ATM, Calculator, Grade Giver, etc.) for learning basics: if-else, loops, switch, and real-life problems.

How to run: Open any .java file in BlueJ or a Java IDE, compile, and run main().

For educational use only.
