## üë¶ About Me

Hi! I‚Äôm a Class 9b student at Christ Church College, Lucknow. I love coding (mostly in Python), but this project is in Java BlueJ as per my syllabus. I want to become an AI engineer one day!

## üìö About the Project

This repository contains my school Java programs for ICSE Class 9 Computer Applications. I wrote about 20 small programs covering:

- `if-else` and `switch` statements
- Loops (`for`, `while`, nested)
- Menu-driven programs
- Real-world mini problems

All code is written and debugged by me in BlueJ, with some help from ChatGPT and my textbook (*Kips Interpreter Computer Applications with BlueJ*) for ideas and theory.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- Practical, short, real-world Java programs for beginners
- Written for school-level projects
- Well-commented and tested
- Easy to run in BlueJ or any Java IDE

## üí° How I Did It

- **95%** of the code was written and debugged by me independently in BlueJ.
- For debugging or ideas, I used ChatGPT.
- For theory/examples, I referred to *Kips Interpreter Computer Applications with BlueJ*.
- I used Git and GitHub to track versions and share my work online.

---

## üåç Why on GitHub?

- To keep my code safe
- To learn version control
- To help other students with simple examples

---

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run

- Open any `.java` file in BlueJ or any standard Java IDE.
- Compile and run the `main` method.
- Follow the on-screen instructions for each program.

---

## üìú License

**For educational purposes only.**

## üöÄ Try It Yourself!

Pick any file, open it in BlueJ, and see what happens! Each program is interactive‚Äîenter your own values and see the results. If you‚Äôre a beginner, try changing the code and see what you learn!
